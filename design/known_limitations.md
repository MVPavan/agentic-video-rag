# Known Limitations

1. Current implementation is deterministic and synthetic; it does not run real video ML models.
2. Datastores are in-memory abstractions and not production-backed services.
3. Query decomposition is rule-based and may miss nuanced intent.
4. Temporal localization uses simplified scoring and smoothing logic.
5. Release readiness focuses on contract correctness rather than real-world model quality.
